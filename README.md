Important Instructions: We've used our own model path in the app.py script, to run the program correctly in your system, make changes to the model's path in python code 
 i.e change the path 
 
 model1=load_model(r'D:\Usman\IBM Project\Model\body.h5')
 model2=load_model(r'D:\Usman\IBM Project\Model\level.h5') 
 
 to whatever path in which your models are stored.
 
Install the following python libraries to run the program correctly
1. Numpy
2. Scikit-learn
3. Flask
4. Pandas
5. Keras
6. Tensorflow

After installing these libraries, just run the app.py file
